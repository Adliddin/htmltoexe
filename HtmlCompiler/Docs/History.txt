 2017.3 (03/01/2017)
 
  * This is a very special release of HTML Compiler, that finally pass
    around the previous limitation of executables larger than 500MB.
    
    HTML Compiler uses a new approach to compile the application's
    executable files, which is fast, reliable and less prone to errors.
    
    Even when now it's possible to compile a 1GB executable, it's not
    very recommendable to do something like that.
    
    If we need to use larger files with our applications, the best
    approach continue be to excluding that files from the compilation.

    Anyway the HTML Compiler compiler works now fast, realiable and
    less prone to errors, so this is a very special release.

 2016.21 (09/01/2016)

    for all the external links. This is probably what the used

  * Add the new "appCanClose" Javascript function "event" for our
    applications. We can use this new stuff in order to confirm the
    application termination, that is, we can ask the user, for example,

  * Add the new external function "appFileExists", which allow
    us to check if an specific file outside the application exists

    executable file and also absolute system file paths.
  
  * Now the external functions "appReadFile", "appOpenFile" and 
    "appOpenFileWith" never raises any error in runtime, but 
    continue to raise errors in designtime. Take a look about
    the new added "appFileExists" external Javascript function.
    
  * Fix problems when reading files causes with their encoding:
    the program saves the files and expect files with an UTF-8
    codification, and this are not consistent in the past. Now
    the program write and read with that codification.

  * Add an uninstaller feedback URL to the program installer in

    application in a window who take in consideration the app's
    options you specified. Note that not all the features are
    available in this preview window, which is intended to take
    a look at the application in a "visual way" and not in a
    "behaviour way". To do this you can compile/build the app.

    addition to program's project files to be automatically opened.
